# Mobile Sales Performance Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of mobile sales performance, helping business stakeholders make data-driven decisions. The dashboard covers key sales metrics, customer insights, and payment trends to optimize revenue and customer satisfaction.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

### The analysis is based on an Excel dataset with the following tables:

**fact_orders:** Main transactional data, including sales revenue, units sold, customer ratings, and order details.

**dim_city:** City-related details to analyze geographic sales distribution.

**dim_payment:** Payment method details for identifying customer payment preferences.

**dim_product:** Mobile product details, including brand and model information.

## üéØ Problem Statement

**A mobile phone retailer wants to analyze sales performance across different cities, payment methods, and mobile brands. The goal is to gain insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and revenue generation to optimize future sales strategies.**

**Additionally, the business seeks to implement Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule) to identify:**

**The top 20% of mobile models that contribute to 80% of total sales revenue.**

**The most profitable cities and customer segments driving the majority of revenue.**

**The payment methods that generate the highest transaction value and frequency.**

## üìà DAX Measures I Have Used

- ### Total Revenue

```
Total Revenue = SUM(fact_orders[Sales])
```

- ### Total Unit Sold

```
Total Unit Sold = SUM(fact_orders[Units Sold])
```

- ### Average Price Per Unit

```
Average Price Per Unit = AVERAGE(fact_orders[Price Per Unit])
```

- ### Average Customer Ratings
```
Average Customer Ratings = AVERAGE(fact_orders[Customer Ratings])
```

- ### Best Performing Model

```
Best Performing Model = 
TOPN(
    1, SUMMARIZE(dim_product , dim_product[Mobile Model]) , 
    [Total Revenue] ,DESC
 )
```

- ### Worst Performing Model

```
Worst Performing Model = 
TOPN(
    1,SUMMARIZE(dim_product,dim_product[Mobile Model]) , [Total Revenue] ,ASC
    )
```

- ### Pareto Analysis For Top Mobile Model
```
Product pareto = 

VAR _rank = RANKX(ALLSELECTED(dim_product[Mobile Model]) , [Total Revenue])

VAR _fixed = CALCULATE([Total Revenue] , ALLSELECTED(fact_orders))

VAR _cum_sum = CALCULATE([Total Revenue] , TOPN(_rank , ALLSELECTED(dim_product[Mobile Model]) , [Total Revenue]))

var _cum_sum_percentage = DIVIDE(_cum_sum , _fixed)

return _cum_sum_percentage
```

- ### Pareto Analysis For Top City
```
City Pareto = 

VAR _rank = RANKX(ALLSELECTED(dim_city[City]) , [Total Revenue])

VAR _fixed = CALCULATE([Total Revenue] , ALLSELECTED(fact_orders))

VAR _cum_sum = CALCULATE( [Total Revenue] , TOPN( _rank , ALLSELECTED(dim_city[City]) , [Total Revenue]))

VAR _cum_sum_percentage = DIVIDE(_cum_sum , _fixed)

RETURN _cum_sum_percentage
```
